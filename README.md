# ‚ö° Electricity Bill Generator

## üìò Description

**Electricity Bill Generator** is a Java-based desktop application designed to automate the process of generating electricity bills based on user input. It allows users to input customer details and the number of electricity units consumed, calculates the total amount based on a fixed rate, and displays the bill in a formatted layout. Users can also export the bill as a professional PDF document.

This project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in Java and uses **Java Swing** for building the GUI and **iText** library for generating PDFs. It is a great educational tool and a practical utility app for basic billing needs.
